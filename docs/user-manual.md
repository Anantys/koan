## Beginner — Daily Basics

Everything you need to use Kōan day-to-day. If you've just installed Kōan, start here.

### Your First Mission

Send a message to Kōan via Telegram (or Slack). If it looks like a task, Kōan automatically queues it as a mission:

> *"Audit the auth module for security issues"*

For explicit control, use the `/mission` command:

```
/mission Refactor the payment service to use async/await
```

**`/mission`** — Queue a new mission for the agent to work on.

- **Usage:** `/mission <description>`
- **Options:**
  - `/mission --now <description>` — Insert at the top of the queue (next to run)
  - `/mission [project:webapp] <description>` — Target a specific project

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/mission Add input validation to the signup form` — Queue a feature task
- `/mission --now Fix the broken CI pipeline` — Urgent fix, skip the queue
- `/mission [project:api] Write integration tests for the /users endpoint` — Target a specific project
</details>

### Mission Lifecycle

Every mission flows through a simple lifecycle:

```
Pending  →  In Progress  →  Done ✓
                          →  Failed ✗
```

1. **Pending** — Queued and waiting. Kōan picks missions from the top of the queue.
2. **In Progress** — Kōan is actively working on it via the configured CLI provider.
3. **Done** — Completed successfully. Code is in a `koan/*` branch, often with a draft PR.
4. **Failed** — Something went wrong. Kōan logs the reason and moves on.

By default, Kōan processes one mission at a time. When idle, it picks the next pending mission automatically. For concurrent execution, see [Parallel Sessions](#parallel-sessions).

### Chatting with Kōan

Just send a regular message — Kōan classifies it automatically. Short conversational messages get instant replies (chat mode). Task-like messages get queued as missions.

If Kōan misclassifies your message, use `/chat` to force chat mode:

**`/chat`** — Force a message to be treated as chat, not a mission.

- **Usage:** `/chat <message>`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/chat What do you think about using Redis for caching?` — Ask for an opinion without creating a mission
- `/chat How's your day going?` — Just talk
</details>

### Managing Your Queue

**`/list`** — See all pending and in-progress missions.

- **Aliases:** `/queue`, `/ls`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/list` — Check what's queued up before adding more work
- `/ls` — Quick glance at the queue
</details>

**`/cancel`** — Remove a pending mission from the queue.

- **Usage:** `/cancel <number>` or `/cancel <keyword>`
- **Aliases:** `/remove`, `/clear`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/cancel 3` — Cancel the 3rd pending mission
- `/cancel auth` — Cancel the mission matching "auth"
</details>

**`/abort`** — Abort the current in-progress mission and move to the next one.

- **Usage:** `/abort`
- The running Claude subprocess is killed, the mission is moved to Failed, and the agent loop picks the next pending item.

**`/priority`** — Move a pending mission to a different position in the queue.

- **Usage:** `/priority <n>` (move to top) or `/priority <n> <position>`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/priority 5` — Move mission #5 to the top of the queue
- `/priority 3 2` — Move mission #3 to position #2
</details>

### Checking Progress

**`/status`** — Get a quick overview of Kōan's state: what's running, what's queued, loop health.

- **Aliases:** `/st`
- **Related:** `/ping` (is the loop alive?), `/usage` (detailed quota), `/metrics` (success rates)

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/status` — "Is Kōan working? What's it doing?"
- `/ping` — Quick health check
- `/metrics` — See mission success/failure rates
</details>

**`/live`** — See real-time progress from the currently running mission.

- **Aliases:** `/progress`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/live` — Check what Kōan is doing right now during a long mission
</details>

**`/logs`** — Show the last 10 lines from run.log and awake.log, formatted in code blocks.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/logs` — Quick check of recent agent and bridge output without SSH access
</details>

**`/quota [remaining_%]`** — Check remaining API quota (live, no cache), or override the internal estimate.

- **Aliases:** `/q`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/quota` — See how much API budget is left before adding heavy missions
- `/quota 32` — Tell Kōan it has 32% remaining (fixes drift when internal estimate is wrong)
- If Kōan is paused due to quota but the API is actually available, `/quota 50` will correct the estimate and clear the pause
</details>

**`/verbose`** / **`/silent`** — Toggle real-time progress updates. When verbose is on, Kōan sends progress messages as it works.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/verbose` — Turn on updates when you want to follow along
- `/silent` — Turn off updates when you're busy (default)
</details>

### Branch Isolation & Reviewing Work

Kōan **never commits to `main`**. All work happens in `koan/*` branches (the prefix is configurable). After completing a mission, Kōan typically:

1. Creates a branch like `koan/refactor-payment-service`
2. Commits changes with clear messages
3. Pushes the branch and creates a **draft PR**

Your workflow:

```bash
# See what Kōan produced
git log koan/refactor-payment-service

# Review the PR on GitHub
# Merge when you're satisfied — or ask Kōan to iterate
```

**The agent proposes. The human decides.** — You always have the final say.

### Multi-Project Basics

Kōan can manage multiple projects simultaneously. It rotates between them based on queue priority and quota.

**`/projects`** — List all configured projects.

- **Aliases:** `/proj`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/projects` — See which repos Kōan is managing
</details>

**`/focus`** — Lock Kōan to a single project. While focused, it only processes missions for that project and skips exploration/reflection.

- **Usage:** `/focus [duration]` (default: 5 hours)
- **Examples:** `/focus`, `/focus 3h`, `/focus 2h30m`

**`/unfocus`** — Exit focus mode, resume normal multi-project rotation.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/focus` — "I need all attention on the webapp for the next few hours"
- `/focus 1h` — Short focused sprint
- `/unfocus` — "OK, back to normal"
</details>

---

## Intermediate — Productivity Workflows

These features turn Kōan from a task runner into a full development workflow partner.

### Code Operations

**`/brainstorm`** — Decompose a broad topic into multiple linked GitHub issues grouped under a master tracking issue.

- **Usage:** `/brainstorm <topic>`, `/brainstorm <project> <topic>`, `/brainstorm <topic> --tag <label>`
- **GitHub @mention:** `@koan-bot /brainstorm <topic>` on an issue

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/brainstorm Improve caching strategy for API responses` — Creates 3-8 sub-issues + master issue
- `/brainstorm koan Add observability and monitoring` — Target a specific project
- `/brainstorm Refactor auth module --tag auth-refactor` — With explicit tag for grouping
</details>

**`/plan`** — Deep-think an idea and produce a structured implementation plan as a GitHub issue.

- **Usage:** `/plan <idea>`, `/plan <project> <idea>`, `/plan <issue-url>` (iterate on existing)
- **GitHub @mention:** `@koan-bot /plan <idea>` on an issue

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/plan Add WebSocket support for real-time notifications` — Get a phased plan before writing any code
- `/plan https://github.com/org/repo/issues/42` — Iterate on an existing issue's plan
- `/plan webapp Add rate limiting to public API endpoints` — Target a specific project
</details>

**`/deepplan`** — Spec-first design with Socratic exploration of 2-3 approaches before planning. For complex missions where design matters more than speed.

- **Usage:** `/deepplan <idea>`, `/deepplan <project> <idea>`, `/deepplan <github-issue-url>`
- **Aliases:** `/deeplan`
- **GitHub @mention:** `@koan-bot /deepplan <idea>` on an issue

The workflow: (1) explores your codebase and surfaces 2-3 distinct design approaches with trade-offs, (2) runs a spec review loop (up to 5 iterations) to ensure the spec is concrete and complete, (3) posts the approved spec as a GitHub issue, (4) queues a `/plan <issue-url>` mission for your review and approval.

When given a GitHub issue URL, the project is automatically detected from the repository and the issue title, body, and all comments are fetched to provide full context for the design exploration.

Use this before `/plan` when the idea is architecturally complex, when you want to explore alternatives before committing, or when design mistakes would be expensive to fix later.

### Understanding Quota Modes

Kōan automatically adapts its work intensity based on remaining API quota:

| Mode | Quota | Behavior |
|------|-------|----------|
| **DEEP** | >40% | Strategic work, thorough exploration, comprehensive reviews |
| **IMPLEMENT** | 15–40% | Focused development, quick wins, efficient execution |
| **REVIEW** | <15% | Read-only analysis, code audits, lightweight tasks |
| **WAIT** | <5% | Graceful pause until quota resets |

You don't need to manage this — Kōan adjusts automatically. Use `/quota` to see the current mode. If the internal estimate drifts from reality, use `/quota <N>` to override (e.g., `/quota 50` tells Kōan it has 50% remaining).

### Exploration Mode

When exploration is enabled, Kōan may autonomously explore a project's codebase between missions — discovering improvements, noting issues, and building context.

**`/explore`** — Enable exploration or show status.
- **Usage:** `/explore [project|all|none]`
- **Aliases:** `/exploration`

**`/noexplore`** — Disable exploration for a project.
- **Usage:** `/noexplore [project]`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/explore webapp` — Let Kōan explore the webapp codebase
- `/explore all` — Enable exploration for all projects
- `/noexplore` — Disable exploration (focus on missions only)
</details>

### Workflow Example: Feature from Idea to PR

Here's a typical multi-step workflow combining several commands:

```
1. /idea Add rate limiting to the public API          # Save the idea
2. /idea promote 1                                     # Ready to work on it
3. /plan Add rate limiting to the public API           # Get a structured plan
4. /implement https://github.com/org/repo/issues/123   # Implement the plan
5. /review https://github.com/org/repo/pull/124        # Review the result
6. # Merge the PR on GitHub when satisfied
```

---

## Power User — Advanced Configuration

Unlock Kōan's full potential with advanced configuration and extensibility features.

### Parallel Sessions

Kōan can work on multiple missions simultaneously using **git worktrees** for isolation. Each parallel session runs in its own worktree with a dedicated branch, so sessions never interfere with each other.

#### How It Works

When parallel sessions are enabled, Kōan can pick up additional pending missions while one is already running. Each session gets:

- **Isolated worktree** — a separate checkout of the repository under `.worktrees/`
- **Dedicated branch** — `koan/session-<id>` branches created automatically
- **Independent subprocess** — a Claude Code process running in the worktree

Sessions are coordinated through a persistent registry (`instance/sessions.json`) with file-level locking for process safety.

#### Configuration

Add `max_parallel_sessions` to your `instance/config.yaml`:

```yaml
# Parallel session configuration
max_parallel_sessions: 2    # Number of concurrent sessions (1-5, default: 2)
```

Set to `1` to disable parallel execution and use the classic sequential mode.

#### Shared Dependencies

To avoid duplicating heavy dependency directories across worktrees, configure `shared_deps` in your project's `projects.yaml`:

```yaml
projects:
  webapp:
    path: ~/Code/webapp
    shared_deps:
      - node_modules
      - .venv
```

These directories are symlinked from the main project into each worktree, saving disk space and setup time.

> **Note:** Shared deps are best used for read-only caches. If a mission's build step modifies dependencies (e.g., `npm install`), it may affect other sessions sharing the same directory.

#### Monitoring

Parallel sessions appear in the standard status commands:

- **`/status`** — Shows count of active parallel sessions
- **`/live`** — Shows progress of all running sessions

Session output is captured to temporary files and collected when each session completes.

#### Cleanup

Worktrees and session branches are automatically cleaned up when a session finishes (success or failure). On startup, Kōan also recovers stale sessions from previous crashes — marking them as failed and removing their worktrees.

To manually clean up orphaned worktrees:

```bash
# From the project directory
git worktree list    # See all worktrees
git worktree prune   # Remove stale references
```

### Deep Exploration

**`/ai`** — Queue an AI exploration mission. Runs as a full agent mission with codebase access — deeper and more thorough than `/magic`.

- **Usage:** `/ai [project]`
- **Aliases:** `/ia`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/ai webapp` — Deep dive into a project, discover insights, suggest improvements
- `/ai` — Explore the default/focused project
</details>

**`/magic`** — Instant creative exploration. Quick single-turn analysis without queuing a mission.

- **Usage:** `/magic [project]`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/magic` — "Surprise me — what's interesting in this codebase?"
- `/magic api` — Quick creative scan of a specific project
</details>

**`/sparring`** — Start a strategic sparring session. This is about thinking, not code — Kōan challenges your assumptions and pushes your ideas.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/sparring` — "Challenge me on my architecture decisions"
</details>

### Configuration Deep-Dive

All behavioral config lives in `instance/config.yaml`. Key settings:

```yaml
# Work intensity
max_runs_per_day: 10          # Max missions per day
interval_seconds: 60          # Seconds between mission checks

# Model selection
models:
  mission: null               # Default (sonnet) for mission work
  chat: null                  # Default for chat replies
  lightweight: haiku          # Quick tasks (formatting, picking)

# Budget thresholds
budget:
  warn_at_percent: 20         # Warn when quota drops below
  stop_at_percent: 5          # Stop working below this

# Tool restrictions (limit what the agent can do)
tools:
  allowed: []                 # Whitelist (empty = all allowed)
  blocked: []                 # Blacklist specific tools

# Start on pause — boot directly into pause mode
# Useful for scheduled launches (cron, launchd) where you want
# the stack running but idle until you explicitly /resume.
start_on_pause: false

# Schedule (when Kōan is allowed to work)
schedule:
  timezone: UTC
  active_hours: "00:00-23:59" # Default: always active

# Skill execution limits
skill_timeout: 3600           # Max seconds for /fix, /implement, /incident
skill_max_turns: 200          # Max agentic turns for heavy skills

# Prompt guard (content safety)
prompt_guard: true            # Enable prompt injection detection
```

See `instance.example/config.yaml` for all available options.

### Per-Project Overrides

Projects are configured in `projects.yaml` at `KOAN_ROOT`. Each project can override defaults:

```yaml
defaults:
  git_auto_merge:
    enabled: false
    strategy: squash

projects:
  webapp:
    path: ~/Code/webapp
    cli_provider: claude       # CLI provider override
    models:
      mission: opus            # Use Opus for this project
    tools:
      blocked: [WebSearch]     # Restrict certain tools
    git_auto_merge:
      enabled: true            # Auto-merge for this project
      strategy: squash
    authorized_users:          # Who can trigger via GitHub @mention
      - username1
```

Key per-project settings:
- **`cli_provider`** — `claude`, `codex`, `copilot`, `local`, or `ollama-launch`
- **`models`** — Override model selection per role
- **`tools`** — Restrict available tools
- **`git_auto_merge`** — Auto-merge completed PRs (strategy: squash/merge/rebase)
- **`authorized_users`** — GitHub users allowed to trigger via @mention
- **`exploration`** — Enable/disable autonomous exploration

### Custom Skills

Kōan's skill system is fully extensible. Install skills from Git repos or create your own.

**Install from Git:**
```
/skill install https://github.com/your-org/koan-skills.git
/skill update <scope>
/skill remove <scope>
```

**Create your own:** Add a `SKILL.md` file in `instance/skills/<scope>/<name>/`:

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
scope: my-scope
description: What this skill does
audience: bridge
commands:
  - name: mycommand
    description: One-line description
    usage: /mycommand <args>
handler: handler.py
---
```

The handler follows a simple pattern:

```python
def handle(ctx):
    # ctx.args — command arguments
    # ctx.project — current project
    # ctx.instance_dir — instance directory path
    return "Response message"  # or None for no reply
```

For prompt-only skills (no handler), put the prompt text after the YAML frontmatter — it's sent directly to Claude.

**Scaffold a skill from a description:**

Instead of writing SKILL.md and handler.py by hand, use `/scaffold_skill` to generate them:

```
/scaffold_skill myteam deploy Deploy to production with rollback support
```

This invokes Claude to produce a valid SKILL.md + handler.py stub in `instance/skills/myteam/deploy/`, validated against the parser before writing. Restart the bridge to load the new skill.

See [koan/skills/README.md](../koan/skills/README.md) for the full authoring guide.

### GitHub @mention Integration

Ten skills can be triggered by commenting `@koan-bot <command>` on GitHub issues and PRs:

| Skill | GitHub trigger |
|-------|---------------|
| `/brainstorm` | `@koan-bot /brainstorm <topic>` on an issue |
| `/implement` | `@koan-bot /implement` on an issue |
| `/fix` | `@koan-bot /fix` on an issue |
| `/review` | `@koan-bot /review` on a PR |
| `/rebase` | `@koan-bot /rebase` on a PR |
| `/reviewrebase` | `@koan-bot /rr` on a PR |
| `/recreate` | `@koan-bot /recreate` on a PR |
| `/refactor` | `@koan-bot /refactor` on a PR or issue |
| `/plan` | `@koan-bot /plan <idea>` on an issue |
| `/profile` | `@koan-bot /profile` on a PR or issue |

Setup requires configuring `github_nickname` and `github_commands_enabled` in `config.yaml`. See [docs/github-commands.md](github-commands.md) for full setup and configuration details.

### CLI Providers

Kōan supports multiple CLI backends. Configure globally via `KOAN_CLI_PROVIDER` env var or per-project in `projects.yaml`.

| Provider | Best for | Docs |
|----------|----------|------|
| **Claude Code** (default) | Full-featured agent, best reasoning | [provider-claude.md](provider-claude.md) |
| **OpenAI Codex** | ChatGPT users who want Codex models | [provider-codex.md](provider-codex.md) |
| **GitHub Copilot** | Teams with existing Copilot licenses | [provider-copilot.md](provider-copilot.md) |
| **Local LLM** | Offline, privacy, zero API cost | [provider-local.md](provider-local.md) |

### Language Preference

**`/language`** — Set or reset the reply language.

- **Usage:** `/language <lang>`, `/language reset`
- **Aliases:** `/lng`

**`/french`** / **`/english`** — Quick language switches.

- **Aliases:** `/fr`, `/francais`, `/français` / `/en`, `/anglais`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/fr` — Switch to French replies
- `/en` — Switch back to English
- `/language reset` — Use default language
</details>

### System Management

**`/pause`** — Pause mission processing. Kōan stays running but won't pick up new missions.

- **Aliases:** `/sleep`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/pause` — Temporarily stop mission work without shutting down
- Resume with `/resume` when ready
</details>

**`/resume`** — Resume mission processing after a pause (manual or automatic).

- **Aliases:** `/work`, `/awake`, `/run`, `/start`

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/resume` — Unpause after a manual `/pause` or quota exhaustion
</details>

**`/shutdown`** — Shutdown both the agent loop and the messaging bridge.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/shutdown` — Gracefully stop everything (e.g., before system maintenance)
</details>

**`/update`** — Finish the current mission, pull updates, and restart.

- **Aliases:** `/upgrade`
- Graceful update: waits for the current mission to complete before pulling and restarting.
- If the update fails, Kōan still restarts (you asked for it).
- Use `/restart` if you just need a fresh start without pulling code.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/update` — "Finish what you're doing, update yourself, and come back"
- `/upgrade` — Same as `/update`
</details>

**`/restart`** — Restart both agent and bridge processes without pulling new code.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/restart` — Force a restart when Kōan is already up to date but you need a fresh start
</details>

**`/snapshot`** — Export memory state to a portable snapshot file for backup or migration.

<details>
<summary>Use cases</summary>

- `/snapshot` — Back up Kōan's memory before a major change
</details>

### Memory System

Kōan maintains persistent memory across sessions through several interconnected files:

- **`memory/summary.md`** — Global summary of learnings across all projects
- **`memory/projects/<name>/`** — Per-project learnings and context
- **`journal/YYYY-MM-DD/project.md`** — Daily logs of what Kōan did
- **`soul.md`** — Agent personality definition (see [Personality Customization](#personality-customization))

Memory is automatically compacted over time. Kōan uses it to build context for each mission, remembering past decisions, patterns, and mistakes.

### Personality Customization

Edit `instance/soul.md` to define Kōan's personality. This file shapes how Kōan communicates, what tone it uses, and what personality traits it exhibits. It's loaded into every interaction.

The design principle: code is generic and open source; instance data (including personality) is private. Fork the repo, write your own soul.

### Auto-Update

Kōan can automatically check for and apply updates from upstream. Configure in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
auto_update:
  enabled: true
  check_interval: 3600    # Seconds between checks
  notify: true             # Notify via Telegram when updating
```

See [docs/auto-update.md](auto-update.md) for details.

The dashboard binds to `localhost` only — not accessible from the network.

### Deployment

For advanced deployment scenarios, see the existing documentation:

- [Docker deployment](docker.md)
- [SSH tunnel setup](ssh-setup.md)
- [Always-up Railway deployment](spec-always-up-railway.md)
